    impact: [
      'Initial Deployment (Week 1) ‚ö†Ô∏è:\n\n‚Ä¢ Achieved 70% digitization accuracy\n\n‚Ä¢ Experienced 10% increase in CVT rework due to misclassifications\n\n‚Ä¢ Required additional agent verification as safety net',
      'Optimized Solution (Week 4) ‚úÖ:\n\n‚Ä¢ Improved accuracy from 70% to 95% through model tuning and feedback loops\n\n‚Ä¢ Reduced onboarding time from 3 hours to 2 hours (33% ‚¨áÔ∏è) and eventually to 30 mins (90% ‚¨áÔ∏è)\n\n‚Ä¢ Decreased funnel drop-offs by 15%, directly increasing driver acquisition',
      'Long-term Outcomes üöÄ:\n\n‚Ä¢ Successfully scaled across UK, Australia and New Zealand markets\n\n‚Ä¢ Implemented 6-phase CVT transformation roadmap, reducing operational costs by 40%\n\n‚Ä¢ Created foundation for fully automated compliance checks\n\n‚Ä¢ Enabled rapid market expansion by removing supply-side bottlenecks'

    lessons: [
      'Driver experience optimization is equally important as backend automation ‚Äî visual cues and simplified flows increased first-attempt success by 35%',
      'Starting with a rapid prototype accelerated stakeholder buy-in and allowed for early validation before significant engineering investment',
      'Geographic document variations required market-specific model tuning and continuous improvement cycles',
      'Cross-functional collaboration across CVT, Operations, Supply, Data Science and Engineering teams was essential for navigating complex stakeholder requirements',
      'AI/ML solutions benefit from human-in-the-loop designs initially, allowing for progressive automation as confidence increases'
